Fast and slow pointer techniques are often used to solve problems involving linked lists or arrays, particularly when detecting cycles, finding the middle element, etc.

Here’s a general pseudocode structure for solving problems with the fast and slow pointer approach:

---

### Problem 1: Detecting a Cycle in a Linked List
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle.

### Input:
- A linked list with `head`

### Output:
- Return `true` if a cycle exists, otherwise `false`.

### Pseudocode:

```
function hasCycle(head):
    // Initialize two pointers: slow and fast
    slow = head
    fast = head

    // Traverse the linked list
    while fast is not null and fast.next is not null:
        // Move slow pointer by 1 step
        slow = slow.next
        // Move fast pointer by 2 steps
        fast = fast.next.next

        // If slow and fast meet, there's a cycle
        if slow == fast:
            return true

    // If fast reaches the end, there's no cycle
    return false
```

---

### Problem 2: Finding the Middle of a Linked List
Find the middle node of a linked list.

### Input:
- A linked list with `head`

### Output:
- Return the middle node.

### Pseudocode:

```
function findMiddle(head):
    // Initialize slow and fast pointers
    slow = head
    fast = head

    // Traverse the linked list
    while fast is not null and fast.next is not null:
        // Move slow pointer by 1 step
        slow = slow.next
        // Move fast pointer by 2 steps
        fast = fast.next.next

    // When fast pointer reaches the end, slow pointer will be at the middle
    return slow
```

### Problem 3: Finding the Start of a Cycle in a Linked List
If a cycle exists in a linked list, find the starting node of the cycle.

### Input:
- A linked list with `head`

### Output:
- Return the starting node of the cycle.

### Pseudocode:

```
function findCycleStart(head):
    // Initialize slow and fast pointers
    slow = head
    fast = head
    cycleExists = false

    // First, detect if there is a cycle
    while fast is not null and fast.next is not null:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if slow == fast:
            cycleExists = true
            break

    // If no cycle is detected, return null
    if not cycleExists:
        return null

    // Move slow to head, keep fast where it met slow
    slow = head

    // Move both pointers at the same pace (1 step at a time)
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    // The point where they meet is the start of the cycle
    return slow
```

### Problem 4: Find Kth Element from End in a Linked List
Find the k-th node from the end of a linked list.

### Input:
- A linked list with `head`
- An integer `k`

### Output:
- Return the k-th node from the end.

### Pseudocode:

```
function findKthFromEnd(head, k):
    // Initialize two pointers: fast and slow
    slow = head
    fast = head

    // Move fast pointer k steps ahead
    for i = 0 to k - 1:
        if fast is null:
            return null  // If k is larger than the list length
        fast = fast.next

    // Move both slow and fast pointers at the same pace
    while fast is not null:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    // When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the k-th node from the end
    return slow
```

### Key Ideas Behind Fast and Slow Pointers:
- **Cycle Detection**: Fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. If there’s a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet inside the cycle.
- **Middle of Linked List**: Fast pointer moves twice as fast as slow. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be in the middle.
- **Kth Element from End**: Fast pointer is moved `k` steps ahead. When fast pointer reaches the end, slow pointer will be at the k-th node from the end.

This approach optimizes problems where we need to traverse the list in a single pass or detect cycles.
