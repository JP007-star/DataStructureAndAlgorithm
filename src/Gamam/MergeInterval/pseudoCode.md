The **Merge Intervals** problem typically involves merging overlapping intervals in a list of intervals. This is a common problem, particularly in scheduling or range-related tasks.

Hereâ€™s the general approach and pseudocode for merging intervals:

### Problem:
Given a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals and return the resulting list of merged intervals.

### Input:
- A list of intervals, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]`

### Output:
- A list of merged intervals

### Assumptions:
- Each interval is a pair of integers `[start, end]` where `start <= end`.
- The intervals may or may not be sorted initially.

---

### Pseudocode:

```
function mergeIntervals(intervals):
    // If there are no intervals or only one, return the intervals as is
    if length of intervals <= 1:
        return intervals

    // Sort the intervals by their start time
    sort intervals by intervals[i][0]

    // Initialize a result list and add the first interval to it
    result = []
    result.append(intervals[0])

    // Iterate through each interval
    for i = 1 to length of intervals - 1:
        // Get the last merged interval from the result
        lastMergedInterval = result.last()

        // If the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval
        if intervals[i][0] <= lastMergedInterval[1]:
            // Merge the intervals by updating the end of the last merged interval
            lastMergedInterval[1] = max(lastMergedInterval[1], intervals[i][1])
        else:
            // If no overlap, add the current interval to the result
            result.append(intervals[i])

    // Return the merged intervals
    return result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the intervals by their starting time. This is crucial to ensure that overlapping intervals are adjacent in the list, making it easier to merge them.

2. **Merging**:
    - Iterate through the sorted list of intervals.
    - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the last merged interval in the result list.
    - If there is an overlap (i.e., the current interval's start time is less than or equal to the previous interval's end time), merge the intervals by updating the end time of the last interval to the maximum of the two end times.
    - If there is no overlap, simply add the current interval to the result list.

3. **Result**: After processing all intervals, the result list will contain only the merged intervals.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the intervals takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of intervals.
- Merging the intervals takes **O(n)** since we only traverse the list once after sorting.
- Overall time complexity: **O(n log n)**

### Example:

**Input**:
```
[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

**Steps**:
1. Sort intervals: `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]` (already sorted).
2. Start merging:
    - Merge `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` into `[1, 6]`.
    - No overlap between `[1, 6]` and `[8, 10]`, so add `[8, 10]`.
    - No overlap between `[8, 10]` and `[15, 18]`, so add `[15, 18]`.

**Output**:
```
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

This pseudocode effectively handles the merging of overlapping intervals, ensuring an optimal solution in terms of both time and space complexity.
